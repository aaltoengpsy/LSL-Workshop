    "\n",
    "In practice, LSL use is always associated with an external data source. This could simply be sending data points or markers from external software (like a game engine) or accessing sensor readings with Python and pushing them to an outlet. Sometimes you'll want to use separate computers altogether for sampling and recording to reduce the computational load on a single machine. In this case, LSL's built-in networking is extremely convenient.\n",

    "Even if your sensing solution [supports LSL](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/info/supported_devices.html), when doing HCI research, sometimes your participants will be interacting with software that is not developed with Python (e.g. web applications). While the core of LSL - liblsl - is available for other languages (C and C++ having active development at the time of writing, with Java, C# and MATLAB seemingly in a limbo), there's a more flexible option that is not dependent on language-specific support: the good old [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) request. In essence, your application can do a HTTP request to a Python server, which will then pass a marker to LSL. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method is fairly language-agnostic as most commonly used programming languages are able to make HTTP requests, but due to the nature of the protocol, this is only really useful for marker information. For continous data, you might be interested in [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), though it's not nearly as convenient as LSL since you'll need to handle connectivity issues yourself!\n",
