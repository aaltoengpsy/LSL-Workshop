This could simply be sending data points or markers from external software (like a game engine) or accessing sensor readings with Python and pushing them to an outlet.

In this case, LSL's built-in networking is extremely convenient.\n",

Didn't we just specify in `active_channels` that we're collecting from channel `0` (A1)? This is because the BITalino has digital channels as well as analog. When using the [`device.start`](https://github.com/BITalinoWorld/revolution-python-api/blob/master/bitalino.py#L139) function, we specify which *analog* channels (A1-A6) are active. However, when using the [`device.read`](https://github.com/BITalinoWorld/revolution-python-api/blob/master/bitalino.py#L436) function, we read data from ALL channels, including digital. All digital channels are always activated when `start` is called. In other words, the digital channels are appended in the data before the analog channels, meaning that indices 5-10 of `data` will correspond to the analog ports A1-A5.\n",
