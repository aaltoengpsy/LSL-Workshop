If you recall, our stream's type was defined as `float32`. If, somehow, the values we output to the outlet should be exactly two decimals long, we could **a)** multiply the rounded values by 10 and convert them to integers, **b)** convert them to [integer ratios](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#float.as_integer_ratio) before pushing them to the network or **c)** render them as strings before pushing them to the network. \n",

    "`marker_gen.py`, `sample_gen.py` only contain the imports necessary to complete the exercise. Your task is to write a script in both files so that `marker_gen` pushes a marker to a stream with the ID `b-marker stream` when a random float is greater than 0.85, while `sample_gen.py` pushes random floating point numbers between 0 and 1000 at a 10Hz sample rate. You can use the example code above as a starting point.\n",
