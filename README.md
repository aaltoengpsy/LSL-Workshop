# Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) Workshop

This workshop covers the basics of lab streaming layer (LSL), a networking / data streaming framework for laboratory contexts. We'll take a look at the core concepts that you should understand when working with LSL, as well as how collecting and saving both discrete and continuous data works. Finally, a couple of application examples are shared. You'll get to practice using LSL through a few exercises along the way.

The goal of this workshop is to give you an overview of what LSL is and what it is capable of. Hopefully, by the end of it, you'll be ready to start implementing its use in your own research!

- [Prerequisites](./00_prerequisites.ipynb) contains instructions for setting up the tools you need to complete parts 2-4 of the workshop. Scripts for testing your setup are also included.
- [Introduction](./01_intro.ipynb) contains an introduction to the core concepts of LSL, as well as guidance for where to look for more information.
- [Streaming](./02_streaming.ipynb) contains an introduction to setting up an LSL server and streaming data and markers to it.
- [Logging](./03_logging.ipynb) introduces a simple way to log streamed data with timestamps created by LSL.
- [Advanced](./04_advanced.ipynb) contains a couple of ideas for configuring LSL, e.g. for use with the BITalino biosignal device or web interfaces.
