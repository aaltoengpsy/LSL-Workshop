# Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) Workshop

This workshop goes over the core concepts of LSL, as well as collecting and saving sensor data and markers. Finally, examples of advanced use are shared.

The goal of this workshop is to give you an overview of what LSL is and what it is capable of. Any practical applications are left to be independently implemented.

- [Prerequisites](./00_prerequisites.ipynb) contains instructions for setting up the tools you need to complete parts 2-4 of the workshop. Scripts for testing your setup are also included.
- [Introduction](./01_intro.ipynb) contains an introduction to the core concepts of LSL, as well as guidance for where to look for more information.
- [Streaming]() contains an introduction to setting up an LSL server and streaming data and markers to it.
- [Logging]() introduces a simple way to log streamed data with timestamps created by LSL.
- [Applications]() contains a couple of ideas for configuring LSL, e.g. for use with the BITalino or web interfaces.
